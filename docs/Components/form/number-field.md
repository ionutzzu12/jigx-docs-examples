:::VerticalSplitItem
Number fields in forms simplify the process of entering numerical information. They feature built-in validation to ensure only valid numbers are input. This optimizes user experience by automatically presenting a numeric keypad, facilitating quicker and more accurate data entry.

The component can only be used in a [jig.default](<./../../Jig Types/jig_default.md>) inside of a [form](./../form.md) component for an input of a numeric value.

The `number-field` component can be used independently or within a `form` component, each offering distinct benefits. As a standalone, it provides flexibility for isolated usage without requiring a form structure. When wrapped in a form, it leverages the formâ€™s instanceId, enabling better coordination and usability when managing multiple fields in a jig.

## Configuration options

Some properties are common to all components, see [Common component properties]() for a list and their configuration options.

| **Core structure** |                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `instanceId`       | The unique identifier for the number-field.                                                                  |
| `label`            | Provide a label/name for the number-field. 'Label' is displayed as a placeholder when no value is specified. |

| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `color`                           | Sets the color of the number-field property based on conditions by using the `when` property. First evaluated to `true` will be used. Choose a color from the provided color palette. Default color is grey if the property is not specified in the YAML. See the list of available colors in [Jigx color palette](https://docs.jigx.com/jigx-color-palette).                                                                |
| `errorText`                       | Add text, string, or expressions to show text under the number-field indicating an error/invalid value in the field. Text is shown in `isNegative` (red) styling with a red exclamation icon on the right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `format`                          | Text Format of the value entered. Format is enabled only if field is configured to disabled.  `style: isDisabled: true`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `helperText`                      | Add text, string, or expressions to guide users by showing text under the number-field. Helper text is displayed only when there is no errorText.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `icon`                            | Add an icon to the number-field, for example a dollar icon. The icon apprears on the far right of the field.  A list of icons is available. See [Jigx icons](https://docs.jigx.com/jigx-icons) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `initialValue`                    | The `initialValue` is the value that will be displayed in the number-field when the form is initially loaded. You can use this property to preset the field with a default number so that you do not have to manually select it. Using the `reset-state` action with `initialValues` does not clear the field, it resets the field back to it's `initialValue`.                                                              |
| `isAutoFocused`                   | If `true` the number-field will get focus immediately after the form is displayed and the number keyboard will be opened automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `isHidden`                        | If `true` the number-field will be hidden on the form. If set to `false` the field will be shown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `isIgnored`                       | When `true`, the field will be ignored when submitting the form and the content will not be stored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `isOptionalLabelHidden`           | If the field is optional you can turn off the "(optional)" label by setting this field to `true`. This property works in combination with `isRequired: false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `isRequired`                      | Set to `true` when the field is required. Useful when you use it in form submission as the submit button remains disabled until the number-field has a numeric input. Set to `false` the number-field is optional and will have (optional) in the label.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `isReturnKeyEnabledAutomatically` | When set to `true`, the keyboard disables the return/done key when there is no number and automatically enables it when there is a number. The default value is `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `isSensitive`                     | If set to `true`, the number input obscures the number entered so that sensitive numbers stay secure. For example, bank card account details or salary details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `isTextClearedOnFocus`            | When set to `true`, the number-field is automatically cleared when editing begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `KeyboardType`                    | Determines which keyboard to open. Default is number-pad. You can select one of the following:&#xA;- `decimal-pad`&#xA;- `number-pad`&#xA;- `numeric`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `minimum`                         | Set the minimum number limit. Used with the `maximum` property allows you to set an available number range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `maximum`                         | Set the maximum number limit. Used with the `minimum` property allows you to set an available number range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `nextProperty`                    | Name of the property you want to focus next in the form when you use return/next on a keyboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `stepper`                         | When the stepper `isEnabled` property is set to `true` a - and + icon is added to the right of the number field allowing you to add or subtract numbers. Use the `value` property to determine the numerical increments when the icon is pressed. For example, `value: 5` will increase the number-field by 5 each time the + icon is pressed. The stepper property is great for an invoicing or order form.                 |
| `style`                           | The following property settings are available:&#xA;- `flex` - Flex property if rendered inside row.&#xA;- `isBusy` - Displays spinner on right side of field. It removes any  configured icon.&#xA;- `isDisabled` - disables the number-field preventing any input text.&#xA;- `isPositive` - a green icon displays on the right of the number-field.&#xA;More than one can be true. It will be evaluated based on priority. |
| `value`                           | The value to show in the number-field when the form initially loads. This can be combined with the `isDisable` style to preset the value that cannot be edited on the form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Number Field on Form

::Image[]{src="https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/ZehuKgdayEDjBvecia7S7_cc-numberfield.png" size="82" position="center" caption="Form with number field" alt="Form with number fields" signedSrc="https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/ZehuKgdayEDjBvecia7S7_cc-numberfield.png" width="800" height="805" darkWidth="800" darkHeight="805"}

The form use multiple `number-fields` property for numeric values with the following optional properties set:

1. `stepper` property to increase or decrease the number.
2. `color` property to color the label and number field purple.
3. `icon` property to show the number represents a currency in dollars.
4. `IntialValue` property preloads with a number when the form loads. The number is set using an expression.
5. `isSensitive` property obsecures the numbers when entered in the field.
